Customer Lifetime Value.
There are 2 files in this repo
1- RFM_Data_Exploration.ipynb: which is the file reading the initial raw data and then cleaning, exploring the data, and showing the spending patterns of clients.
2- RFM_ML.ipynb: in this file I clustered the data into groups based on their monetary value after analyzing the variables. I then did customer segmentation based on this clustering. Just after that, I did some feature engineering to the data, and I then injected the data into several machine learning algorithms and 1 deep neural network algorithm. By choosing the best algorithm to fit the data, I developed a new dataset that predicts the customer lifetime value or customer spending over the next year. I then compared the spending of all customers between the previous year and the prdicted coming year. Finally I did a table to look at customer retention using the previous data.
